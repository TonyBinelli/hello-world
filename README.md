# hello-world
Following the tutorial
I´m learning C# with a course on www.devu.com
Kind of get stucked there a little bit and started to have a look a this github thing bevor I get frustrated and quit the whole show.
I´m doing the tutorial mission here to see what this is all about. Maybe I can have a look an the code from someone else to learn something. If i´m not too stupid or lazy of course.
